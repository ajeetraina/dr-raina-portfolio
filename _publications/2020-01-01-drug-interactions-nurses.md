## Abstract

**Background**: Nurses play a critical role in medication administration and monitoring patients for potential drug interactions. Their knowledge and awareness regarding drug interactions significantly impact patient safety and treatment outcomes.

**Objective**: To assess the awareness and knowledge of nurses regarding different types of drug interactions and to identify knowledge gaps that could be addressed through targeted educational interventions.

**Methods**: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among nurses working in various departments of a tertiary care hospital. The questionnaire assessed knowledge of drug-drug, drug-food, and drug-disease interactions, as well as awareness of reporting mechanisms for adverse events.

**Results**: The study revealed variable levels of knowledge regarding different types of drug interactions. While most nurses demonstrated good awareness of common drug-drug interactions, knowledge gaps were identified in areas such as drug-food interactions and specific drug-disease contraindications. Nurses with more years of experience and those who had attended continuing education programs showed better knowledge scores. Approximately 65% of participants expressed interest in receiving additional training on drug interactions.

**Conclusion**: The findings highlight the need for regular training and continuing education programs for nurses on medication safety, with specific focus on drug interactions. Implementation of structured educational interventions and accessible reference resources could significantly improve nurses' knowledge and potentially reduce medication-related errors.

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

- Limited awareness of clinically significant drug-food interactions
- Inconsistent knowledge of timing considerations for medication administration
- Inadequate understanding of pharmacokinetic drug interactions
- Variable awareness of hospital reporting mechanisms for medication errors

## Recommendations

1. Implement regular continuing education programs focused on drug interactions
2. Develop pocket reference guides for common drug interactions
3. Establish a hospital-wide medication safety committee with nursing representation
4. Integrate clinical pharmacists into nursing education programs
5. Create an electronic alert system for potential drug interactions during medication administration

The findings from this study emphasize the important role nurses play in medication safety and highlight opportunities to enhance their knowledge and practices regarding drug interactions through targeted educational interventions.
