<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reporting is a critical component of pharmacovigilance, yet there remains significant under-reporting among healthcare professionals. Medical students, as future healthcare providers, need to be adequately trained in recognizing and reporting ADRs.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To assess the knowledge and awareness of ADR reporting among medical undergraduate students using both practical reporting activities and questionnaire-based evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong>: The study involved second-year medical undergraduate students who were divided into two groups. One group was assigned ADR reporting activities in clinical departments, while the other group underwent traditional questionnaire-based assessment. The results were compared to identify the most effective method for enhancing ADR reporting knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Students who participated in practical ADR reporting activities demonstrated significantly better understanding and retention of pharmacovigilance concepts compared to those who only completed the questionnaire. Key findings included improved recognition of ADR manifestations, better understanding of reporting procedures, and increased willingness to participate in pharmacovigilance activities in their future practice.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Incorporating practical ADR reporting activities into the medical curriculum provides a more effective approach to teaching pharmacovigilance concepts than traditional methods. This approach could potentially address the issue of ADR under-reporting by cultivating a culture of reporting among future medical professionals.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Active ADR reporting experience significantly improved studentsâ€™ understanding of pharmacovigilance</li>
  <li>Practical training led to better identification and classification of adverse drug reactions</li>
  <li>Students who participated in hands-on activities showed greater confidence in their ability to report ADRs</li>
  <li>The study highlighted the importance of integrating practical pharmacovigilance training into the medical curriculum</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>

<p>The findings from this study suggest that medical education should incorporate more hands-on training in pharmacovigilance to address the persistent problem of ADR under-reporting. By training medical students early in their careers, we can help establish a stronger culture of ADR reporting among future healthcare professionals.</p>
