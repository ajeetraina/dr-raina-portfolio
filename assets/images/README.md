# Profile Image

Please place Dr. Rangeel Singh Raina's profile image here with the filename `profile.jpg`. 

The image should be:
- A professional headshot with a clear view of the face
- Ideally square or circular in shape
- At least 300x300 pixels in size for good quality
- In JPG or PNG format

You can use the image from the PDF document that was shared, which shows Dr. Raina wearing a blue turban.

# Background Image

You'll also need to add a hero background image named `hero-bg.jpg` which will be used for the hero section of the homepage. This could be:
- A medical or academic themed background
- A photo of the medical college
- An abstract or gradient image related to medicine or pharmacology

Both these images are important for the professional appearance of the website.
