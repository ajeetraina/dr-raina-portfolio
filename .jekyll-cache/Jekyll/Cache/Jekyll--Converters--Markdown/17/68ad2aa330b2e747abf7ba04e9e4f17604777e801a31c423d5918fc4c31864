<p>Patient Empowerment (PE) can be considered as an active and self-determining role of patient than a passive recipient of health related services. It encourages the providerâ€“patient relationship to blossom and helps in clearing patientsâ€™ doubts, confusion and fears to bring in clarity, relief and assurance.</p>

<p>For the active involvement of the patientâ€™s participation in the treatment, one needs to be conversant in a language one can comprehend and interact with the treating physician. Knowledge and skill development play a pivotal role in enhancing self-efficacy of the patient. PE is beneficial to all, i.e. physician, paramedics and the patient. In a vast and populated country like India, PE is a requirement, not a luxury. The empowered patient will be able to speak for oneself, will participate in the decision on treatment option, will research well and educate oneself to enhance confidence level which will bring in adherence to treatment regime.</p>
